# ITC-2400
ITC 2400 - Web and Mobile Development - Fall 2018
This is a website I created as a school project. 
Please create a folder called "images" (excluding the quotation marks), and put the pictures inside there. 
This website is not responsive so I will update this frequently.
Please leave feedback so I can improve the website as much as I can. Thanks!
