# ITC-2400
ITC 2400 - Web and Mobile Development - Fall 2018 - Northeastern University.
This is a website I created as a school project. 
Please start at index.html. 
The images folder is "images" (excluding the quotation marks). As the images are not copyright-free. 
This website is not responsive so I will update this frequently.
Please leave feedback so I can improve the website as much as I can. Thanks!
